Tstat file data analysis
1. tstat_PCA finds the prominant features of each feature subset and retuns the names and order of importance of those features.
2. tstat_2clusters runs our method using the prominant features found in tstat_PCA. The code returns images of throughput distribution, comparison graphs and sequence similarity analysis.
